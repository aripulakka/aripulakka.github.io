I used to write a blog few years ago but I didn't liked the platform I was using so it was not a long story. This github based blog site seems quite interesting and markdown seems to be a fine language so maybe this time the story lasts longer. I am going to write mostly of my hobbies f.ex. metalworking, woodworking and electrical stuff like old computer maintanance and repair.

Hope we both enjoy!
